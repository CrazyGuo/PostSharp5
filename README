5 Ways That PostSharp Can SOLIDify Your Code

This project is a bunch of projects full of example code that's used in a
blog series (available soon at SharpCrafters.com) entitled "5 Ways That PostSharp Can SOLIDify Your Code".

Note that I have included the PostSharp.dll file in this repository, but it's possible that this
DLL will be out of date by the time you use this source (I may keep it current, I may not).  You need
to install PostSharp anyway, so once you've done that, just update the DLL with the latest version, or
alternatively change all your references to the PostSharp.dll file that's likely sitting in a folder
like C:\Program Files\PostSharp

Here are the 5 topics, I will post the blog URLs here once they become public:

1 - Lazy loading of dependencies
	Using PostSharp to help you with Dependency Inversion
	Project 1a is a very simple example
	Project 1b introduces some compile time validations

2 - Authorization
	Getting fine grain control of authorization with PostSharp

3 - Logging/Auditing
	Using PostSharp to painlessly add logging and/or auditing to an entire application

4 - Caching
	Making the use of caching easy and transparent

5 - Transaction Management
	Using PostSharp to avoid writing the same try/begin/commit/catch/rollback/retry/log boilerplate code over and over.
